# Dubliners
Welcome!
This is a silly little project with the goal of creating a random passage generator for sections of James Joyce's short story collection Dubliners.
A random passage of the text will animate on your screen!
Pictures of early 20th century Dublin appear behind the text.
Users can adjust the speed of the animation and shuffle through the bank of passages.
